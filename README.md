# sjcMap-android
An example Android app showing how Mapbox-GL-Native can work with ArcGIS Server basemaps

## Try it yourself
You'll need to add your own Mapbox API token in the `strings.xml` file [here](https://github.com/npeihl/sjcMap-android/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml#L6).

This is very experimental as I'm still learning this.
